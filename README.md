# Servers_dockerfiles
## Description

It's different dockerfiles used for running system containers or "fat containers" and application containers or microservices.
Mainly those dockerfiles use ansible for the configuration of the docker image by retrieving a prebuilt role from ansible-galaxy in order to get a service up and running in your infrastructure easily.
